He shows that the main advantages of TIMS are the following: for those elements that ionise easily the ionisation is highly efficient; the molecular interference spectrum is quite simple; the thermal ionisation produces ions with a small energy spread allowing good mass resolution; and the potential for sample to sample cross contamination is small. Disadvantages are that for some elements of geological interest the ionisation efficiency is low and so the technique is unsuitable for Hf, W and positive Os ions; the chemical preparation of samples is complex and time-consuming; and corrections have to be made for the mass fractionation between isotopes during the process of thermal ionisation."),(0,s.kt)("h4",{id:"gas-source-mass-spectrometry"},"Gas Source Mass Spectrometry"),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Gas source mass spectrometry is used to measure the traditional stable isotopes (H, O, C, S and N) as described by Sharp (2014) and the noble gases (Wieler, 2014).
