Variation diagrams display major element data on bivariate or trivariate plots. These diagrams are used to show the interrelationships between elements in a dataset and from these relationships geochemical processes may be inferred. Variation diagrams based upon trace element concentrations are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. The third use of major element data, plotting the chemical composition of an igneous rock onto a phase diagram, assumes that the chemistry of the rock is the same as that of the original igneous melt. In this case the comparison of a rock composition with experimentally determined phase boundaries for melts of similar composition under a range of physical conditions may allow inferences to be made about the conditions of melting and/or the subsequent crystallisation history of the melt."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"However, before major element data are used in any of these ways it is important that the data are evaluated for quality and are processed in a uniform and consistent manner.

A petrographic evaluation of sample thin sections is helpful for this and allows any alteration products to be identified. Data quality can then be evaluated with respect to the relative proportions of primary and hydrous secondary phases, the value of the loss on ignition (LOI) and the analysis total. \u2018Dry\u2019 samples which contain no hydrous minerals or alteration products should have an analysis total between 99% and 101%, whereas \u2018wet\u2019 samples containing primary hydrous minerals or alteration products may have lower totals due to the loss of volatiles recorded as LOI. For example, island arc andesites are often water-saturated and commonly have primary amphibole, and may therefore have LOIs of 3\u20136% (Ruscitto et al., 2012; Plank et al., 2013).

This is usually governed by the method of sample preparation. Historically, when major elements were determined using solution chemistry, all the Fe was reduced to FeO and reported as such in the chemical analysis. Today major element analyses are generated by XRF and ICP in which samples are converted into a fused, homogeneous glass prior to analysis. If a graphite crucible is used during sample fusion, then all the Fe in the sample is reduced to FeO and the analytical result is presented as FeO. If a platinum crucible is used, all the Fe in the sample is oxidised to Fe2O3 and the analytical result is presented as Fe2O3. It is important to report Fe as it was analysed to allow others to fully assess data quality. This is normally done using the terms FeOT or Fe2O3T, or sometimes as FeO(tot) and Fe2O3(tot), to indicate that all the iron is reported in a single oxidation state.

Major element mobility typically occurs during diagenesis and metamorphism or through interaction with a hydrothermal fluid. In metamorphic rocks element mobility may take place as a result of solid-state diffusion or melt generation and migration."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The mobility of major elements is controlled by three main factors: the stability and composition of the minerals in the unaltered rock, the stability and composition of the minerals in the alteration product and the composition, temperature and volume of the migrating fluid or melt phase.

Thus, careful petrography is an important tool in identifying chemically altered rocks. Scattered trends on variation diagrams are also a useful indicator, although chemical alteration can sometimes produce systematic changes which may mimic other mixing processes such as crystal fractionation. These apparent trends may result from volume changes arising from the removal or addition of a single component of the rock."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"An example of major element mobility is given in the dataset presented in Table 3.1 in which a suite of Permian basalts from Sumatra has been analysed for the major elements.

An example of the conversion steps needed to calculate molar proportions necessary to determine the norm is given in Table 3.3. Weight percent oxide values (column 1) are divided by their molecular weights (column 2) to calculate molecular proportions (column 3).

The norm is calculated using the equivalent weights of the oxides, that is, the molecular weight when one cation is present (Barth, 1952). In the case of oxides such as CaO or TiO2 the equivalent weight is the same as the molecular weight, but for Al2O3 or Na2O the equivalent weight is half the molecular weight. The calculation of a cation norm is illustrated in Table 3.3. In this case the wt.% oxide values (column 1) are divided by their equivalent weights (divide by column 2 and multiply by column 4), converted into cation proportions (column 5) and then converted into cation percent (column 7). Molecules are then constructed according to the standard CIPW rules (Appendix 3.1), although the proportions of the components in which cations are allocated are different from the CIPW norm. The cation norm is not recalculated on a wt.% basis, but is expressed in molecular % (column 10).

This is problematic for mafic rocks where the Fe content is typically much higher than in felsic rocks, and can be an issue for felsic rocks since magmatic systems generally become more oxidising as they evolve. Given that Fe is usually reported as either FeO or as Fe2O3 it is necessary to estimate the Fe2O3/FeO ratio in a given rock. Two approaches have been taken. In volcanic rocks, Middlemost (1989) assigned specific values of Fe2O3/FeO to particular rock types in TA-S space (Figure 3.3). El-Hinnawi (2016b), on the other hand, used a database of >12,000 analyses for which Fe was measured as Fe2+ and Fe3+ to directly calculate the Fe2O3/FeO ratio.
