Data</em></strong></p><iframe width="100%" height="800px" src="https://hehu.fun/ugd/OEBPS/Text/book-part3.xhtml"></iframe><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>This chapter examines the ways in which major element data are used to understand the genesis and evolution of the major rock types. Here we discuss the role of the elements Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K and P – the 10 elements that are traditionally given as oxides in a major element chemical analysis – but do not consider in any depth the volatile elements H, CO2, S or N. Although we recognise that the volatile elements play an important role in understanding the evolution of our planet in terms of chemical mass-balance through volcanic degassing and hydrothermal alteration, a full discussion of these themes is beyond the scope of this text and the reader is referred to other sources (e.g., Luft, 2014). For a detailed discussion of the major element chemistry of the oceans, again we refer the reader elsewhere (e.g., Millero, 2014).</p><p>This chapter is concerned with the three principal ways in which geochemists make use of major element data:</p><ul><li><p>in rock classification,</p></li><li><p>in the construction of variation diagrams</p></li><li><p>in comparison with experimentally determined rock compositions whose conditions of formation are known.</p></li></ul><p>The combination of major and trace elements can often be used to identify the original tectonic setting of igneous and some sedimentary rocks, and this topic is addressed in Chapter 5.</p><p>The application of major element chemistry to rock classification and nomenclature is widely used in igneous petrology and can also be useful for some sedimentary rocks. Variation diagrams display major element data on bivariate or trivariate plots. These diagrams are used to show the interrelationships between elements in a dataset and from these relationships geochemical processes may be inferred. Variation diagrams based upon trace element concentrations are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. The third use of major element data, plotting the chemical composition of an igneous rock onto a phase diagram, assumes that the chemistry of the rock is the same as that of the original igneous melt. In this case the comparison of a rock composition with experimentally determined phase boundaries for melts of similar composition under a range of physical conditions may allow inferences to be made about the conditions of melting and/or the subsequent crystallisation history of the melt.</p><p>However, before major element data are used in any of these ways it is important that the data are evaluated for quality and are processed in a uniform and consistent manner. In particular, it is important that the oxidation state of Fe is treated uniformly, that analysis totals are normalised to exclude the presence of volatiles and that a decision is made about whether the data should are presented as weight percent oxide or as cations. Here we propose a standardised method of data processing to allow a better comparison between data generated using different methods and/or in different laboratories.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="processing-major-element-data">Processing Major Element Data<a class="hash-link" href="#processing-major-element-data" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The first step of any geochemical investigation is to assess the quality of the data to be used. A petrographic evaluation of sample thin sections is helpful for this and allows any alteration products to be identified. Data quality can then be evaluated with respect to the relative proportions of primary and hydrous secondary phases, the value of the loss on ignition (LOI) and the analysis total. ‘Dry’ samples which contain no hydrous minerals or alteration products should have an analysis total between 99% and 101%, whereas ‘wet’ samples containing primary hydrous minerals or alteration products may have lower totals due to the loss of volatiles recorded as LOI. For example, island arc andesites are often water-saturated and commonly have primary amphibole, and may therefore have LOIs of 3–6% (Ruscitto et al., 2012; Plank et al., 2013). In such circumstances, and given the absence of petrographic alteration, low totals because of high LOI may be acceptable. In this case it is good practice to normalise the data on a volatile-free (anhydrous or dry) basis.</p><p>The next step is to assess the oxidation state of Fe. This is usually governed by the method of sample preparation. Historically, when major elements were determined using solution chemistry, all the Fe was reduced to FeO and reported as such in the chemical analysis. Today major element analyses are generated by XRF and ICP in which samples are converted into a fused, homogeneous glass prior to analysis. If a graphite crucible is used during sample fusion, then all the Fe in the sample is reduced to FeO and the analytical result is presented as FeO. If a platinum crucible is used, all the Fe in the sample is oxidised to Fe2O3 and the analytical result is presented as Fe2O3. It is important to report Fe as it was analysed to allow others to fully assess data quality. This is normally done using the terms FeOT or Fe2O3T, or sometimes as FeO(tot) and Fe2O3(tot), to indicate that all the iron is reported in a single oxidation state. Note, however, that reporting all the Fe in a single oxidation state does not reflect the true chemical evolution of magmatic systems, which tend to become more oxidising as they evolve. This topic is discussed further in Section 3.2.2.3.</p><p>Finally, a decision has to be made about the format of the data and whether or not oxide data should be converted to moles or cations. This usually depends on how the data are going to be used. Current practice is to present major element chemistry for rocks as weight (wt.) % and to convert as needed to cations, cation % or parts per million (see Section 3.2.3), although the chemical composition of water is typically presented in molar concentrations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="major-element-mobility">Major Element Mobility<a class="hash-link" href="#major-element-mobility" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Before beginning to classify and investigate the petrogenesis of a suite of samples it is important to consider whether or not they preserve their original chemistry and whether they have been altered in any way. This typically involves chemical changes which take place after rock formation, usually through interaction with a fluid. These changes may sometimes be described as metasomatic. Major element mobility typically occurs during diagenesis and metamorphism or through interaction with a hydrothermal fluid. In metamorphic rocks element mobility may take place as a result of solid-state diffusion or melt generation and migration.</p><p>The mobility of major elements is controlled by three main factors: the stability and composition of the minerals in the unaltered rock, the stability and composition of the minerals in the alteration product and the composition, temperature and volume of the migrating fluid or melt phase. Element mobility may be detected from mineralogical phase and compositional changes that have taken place in a rock as a result of metamorphism or hydrothermal activity and from the mineral assemblages present in associated veins. Thus, careful petrography is an important tool in identifying chemically altered rocks. Scattered trends on variation diagrams are also a useful indicator, although chemical alteration can sometimes produce systematic changes which may mimic other mixing processes such as crystal fractionation. These apparent trends may result from volume changes arising from the removal or addition of a single component of the rock.</p><p>An example of major element mobility is given in the dataset presented in Table 3.1 in which a suite of Permian basalts from Sumatra has been analysed for the major elements. There are two unusual features about these basalt data. First, the samples have very high LOI, indicating significant hydration. This parameter alone can be taken as an indicator of possible major element mobility (e.g., Smith and Humphries, 1998). The Sumatran samples also appear to have very high Na2O contents relative to fresh MORB and MORB glass (Table 3.2b). When recalculated as anhydrous and plotted on a TAS diagram (see Section 3.2) the samples plot between basalts and trachy-basalts (inset, Figure 3.1a), suggesting that they are alkaline basalts. However, given their very high water content, an alternative explanation is that they have been altered by interaction with seawater and have thus become more sodic or spilitised. Further evidence for basalt alteration comes from the study of fluid-mobile trace elements, and this will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The total alkalis versus silica (TAS) diagram for volcanic rocks." src="/assets/images/fig3-1-85d064824169381783a6321bf3fe0593.png" title="火山岩的总碱与二氧化硅 (TAS) 图。" width="1080" height="1313" class="img_E7b_">

These are summarised in Table 3.2 for the major elements and in Table 4.9 for trace elements. Table 3.2a shows major element compositional data for the whole Earth (or the bulk Earth), the silicate Earth (or the bulk silicate Earth, or BSE, a term interchangeable with primitive upper mantle, or PM) and the Earth’s core. The data are expressed in wt.% elemental concentrations and oxygen is shown separately. This is because the core contains no oxygen and so expressing the data as elemental concentrations allows comparisons to be made between the silicate Earth and the core. In addition to the 10 major elements present in most silicate rocks, the metals Ni and Cr and the light elements H, C and S are also included as they constitute a measurable fraction of the composition of the whole Earth. These data are from McDonough (2014a) and assume that the original undifferentiated Earth was similar in composition to carbonaceous chondritic meteorites. It is known that the Earth’s core contains a few wt.% of a light element in addition to Fe and Ni, and the McDonough (2014a) model presented here argues that the principal light element is Si, but that there is also some S present.</p><p>Table 3.2b provides the major element compositions of the major silicate reservoirs. The magnesium number (Mg#), its meaning and calculation are discussed in Section 3.3.2.1. As shown above, the primitive mantle is the same as the bulk silicate Earth – the Earth after the separation of the core but before the development of continental crust. Using the Earth reservoir data from Table 3.2a converted to oxide wt.%, the models of McDonough (2014a) and Palme and O’Neill (2014) are provided. The composition of the depleted mantle (DM) calculated by Workman and Hart (2005) is given for comparison and represents mantle from which some basaltic melt has been extracted. The DM, relative to PM, is more magnesian and slightly depleted in elements such as Ca, Al and Si which are preferentially incorporated into basaltic melt. A mean composition of over 2000 mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) samples from the floor of the major oceans is given and is very slightly different from the mean value of over 3000 MORB glass samples (data from White and Klein, 2014). Note, however, that these compositions simply represent what is found on the floor of the oceans and does not necessarily represent a primitive or primary MORB composition. The mean composition of the continental crust calculated by Rudnick and Gao (2014) is a weighted composite of the compositions of the upper, middle and more mafic lower continental crust.</p><p>Another important major Earth reservoir is the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM), often referred to in the literature as the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) (see Table 3.2c). Fragments of the mantle provide our only direct samples of the CLM and include orogenic peridotites, ophiolites, and xenoliths transported via volcanism. Mantle xenoliths broadly define two compositional types: spinel- and garnet-facies peridotites associated with kimberlites, and spinel-facies peridotites associated with predominantly alkalic rocks. The former are generally found in cratonic settings and the latter in non-cratonic (rift) settings. Table 3.2c shows a compilation of xenolith and primitive upper mantle (PUM) model compositions from Pearson et al. (2014).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="rock-classification">Rock Classification<a class="hash-link" href="#rock-classification" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>With the advent of automated XRF and rapid ICP analytical methods most geochemical investigations produce a large volume of elemental data that allows for the classification of rocks on the basis of their chemical composition. This section reviews the classification schemes in current use and outlines the rock types for which they may be specifically suited. A summary of the classification schemes discussed is given in Box 3.1. We adhere to the guidelines of the International Union of Geological Sciences Sub-commission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks (Le Maitre et al., 2002) for the naming and classification of rocks. We concur that a classification scheme should be easy to use, widely applicable, have a readily understood logical basis and reflect as accurately as possible the existing nomenclature based upon mineralogical criteria.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="classifying-igneous-rocks-using-oxide-oxide-plots">Classifying Igneous Rocks Using Oxide-Oxide Plots<a class="hash-link" href="#classifying-igneous-rocks-using-oxide-oxide-plots" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Bivariate oxide-oxide major element plots are the most straightforward way in which to classify igneous rocks, especially volcanic rocks, and the principal diagrams are summarised below.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-total-alkalis-silica-diagram-tas-for-volcanic-rocks">The Total Alkalis-Silica Diagram (TAS) for Volcanic Rocks<a class="hash-link" href="#the-total-alkalis-silica-diagram-tas-for-volcanic-rocks" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The total alkalis-silica diagram is one of the most useful classification schemes available for volcanic rocks. Using wt.% oxide chemical data from a rock analysis that has been recalculated to 100% on an anhydrous (volatile-free) basis, the sum of Na2O + K2O (total alkalis, TA) and SiO2 (S) are plotted onto the classification diagram. The original version of the diagram (Le Bas et al., 1986) was expanded by Le Maitre et al. (1989) using 24,000 analyses of fresh volcanic rocks (Figure 3.1a). Le Maitre et al. (2002) further expanded the classification to include olivine- and pyroxene-rich rocks (Section 3.2.3.3).</p><p>The field boundaries were defined by minimizing the overlap between adjoining fields, and the boundary coordinates are given in Figure 3.1b. The TAS diagram divides rocks into ultrabasic, basic, intermediate and acid on the basis of their silica content following the usage of Peccerillo and Taylor (1976). The nomenclature is based upon a system of root names with additional qualifiers to be used as necessary. For example, the root name ‘basalt’ may be qualified to ‘alkali basalt’ or ‘sub-alkali basalt’. Some rock names cannot be allocated until the normative mineralogy has been determined. For example, a tephrite contains less than 10% normative olivine, whereas a basanite contains more than 10% normative olivine (see Section 3.2.2 on the norm calculation).</p><p>The TAS classification scheme is intended for common volcanic rocks and should not be used with weathered, altered or metamorphosed volcanic rocks because the alkali elements can be mobilised. Potash-rich rocks (nephelinites, mela-nephelinites) should not be plotted on the TAS diagram, and ultramafic or high-Mg rocks (boninite, komatiite, meimechite, picrite) should be checked for their TiO2 contents before assigning a name from the TAS diagram (see Section 3.2.3.3). Rocks showing obvious signs of crystal accumulation should also be avoided.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="a-tas-diagram-for-plutonic-rocks">A TAS Diagram for Plutonic Rocks<a class="hash-link" href="#a-tas-diagram-for-plutonic-rocks" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Of the various schemes for the naming of plutonic rocks, the two most popular ones based on major element chemistry are the TAS diagram for plutonic igneous rocks (after Wilson, 1989) and the normative Q–Or–Ab triangular plot for granitoids (Section 3.3.2). The TAS diagram for plutonic rocks (Figure 3.2) is useful inasmuch as it is simple and convenient to use. It is important to note, however, that its boundaries are not the same as the boundaries of the TAS diagram for volcanic rocks. There are other classification schemes for plutonic rocks which are based on modal mineralogy, but these are not discussed here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The chemical classification and nomenclature of plutonic rocks using the total alkalis versus silica diagram (adapted by Wilson, 1989, from Cox et al., 1979).

Using data from Hawaiian basalts, MacDonald and Katsura (1964) were the first to define a boundary separating the alkalic and sub-alkalic (tholeiitic) magma series on a TAS diagram. A later study by MacDonald (1968) expanded the boundary to cover a wider range of SiO2. Similar diagrams by Kuno (1966) and Irvine and Baragar (1971) place the boundary in slightly different positions on the TAS plot (Figure 3.3). Currently, the boundary curve of Irvine and Baragar (1971) is the most widely used, although the recent reassessment by El-Hinnawi (2016a) indicates that the coordinates of MacDonald and Katsura (1964) provide the best distinction between the alkalic and sub-alkalic series for basaltic compositions (SiO2 &lt; 52 wt.%). There is less clarity for compositions with a higher SiO2 content. The boundary coordinates are given in the caption to Figure 3.3.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The TAS diagram for volcanic rocks showing" src="/assets/images/fig3-3-d797be3b1d78b4218229dcf41b646f32.png" title="火山岩的 TAS 图" width="1081" height="603" class="img_E7b_">

They were originally defined by Stern et al. (1989) as plutonic rocks containing 55–60 wt.% SiO2 and with Mg# &gt; 0.6 (see Section 3.3.2). However, it is now known that there are sanukitoid suites which range in composition from pyroxenite to quartz monzonite with SiO2 between 38 wt.% and 68 wt.% and Mg# = 0.49–0.89. This is illustrated in the study by Lobach-Zhuchenko et al.

In the context of rock classification it provides the basis for a number of mineralogical classification schemes. The calculated normative mineralogy is based entirely upon the chemistry of the rock and its strength lies in the fact that it permits the classification of rocks, such as glassy rocks, for which the determination of the mode is not possible, and allows a direct comparison to be made between such rocks and their crystalline or metamorphosed counterparts. Hence rocks with the same chemical composition should result in the same normative mineral assemblage, although it is important to note that the norm calculation is sensitive to the oxidation state of iron (see Section 3.2.2.3).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="cipw-norm">CIPW Norm<a class="hash-link" href="#cipw-norm" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>There are a number of different approaches to calculating the norm but the CIPW norm, named after its originators – Cross, Iddings, Pirrson and Washington (Cross et al., 1902) – is the most commonly used. The CIPW norm calculation makes a number of simplifying assumptions and follows a prescribed set of rules. A simplified version of the calculation scheme is given in Appendix 3.1. An example of the conversion steps needed to calculate molar proportions necessary to determine the norm is given in Table 3.3. Weight percent oxide values (column 1) are divided by their molecular weights (column 2) to calculate molecular proportions (column 3). The molecular proportions are the basis of the norm calculation given in Appendix 3.1. At the end of the calculation the resulting normative minerals are multiplied by their molecular weight to recast them into wt.% (column 9). The CIPW norm calculation can be carried out in Excel using the programme norm 4 (<a href="https://minerva.union.edu/hollochk/c_petrology/other_files/norm_calculation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://minerva.union.edu/hollochk/c_petrology/other_files/norm_calculation.pdf</a>) or in a variety of open-source computer programs such as NORRRAM (González-Guzmán, 2016, in R) or CIPWFULL (Al-Mishwat, 2015, in FORTRAN). However, it is important to understand the principles which lie behind the norm calculation, and so before using these programs we recommend the manual calculation of a simple CIPW norm.</p><p>The CIPW norm is widely used in the classification of basalts (Section 3.2.2.4) and in the classification of granitoids (Section 3.2.2.5). Errors can arise in CIPW norm calculations if volatiles in the rock composition are not correctly allocated and if the oxidation state of the iron is incorrectly stated. In addition, some rock types, in particular, cumulate rocks and alkaline rocks with a high CO2 content, may result in the calculation of an improbable range of accessory mineral phases.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-cation-norm">The Cation Norm<a class="hash-link" href="#the-cation-norm" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The Barth-Niggli norm, also known as the cation norm or the molecular norm, is an older norm calculation that is no longer widely used. The norm is calculated using the equivalent weights of the oxides, that is, the molecular weight when one cation is present (Barth, 1952). In the case of oxides such as CaO or TiO2 the equivalent weight is the same as the molecular weight, but for Al2O3 or Na2O the equivalent weight is half the molecular weight. The calculation of a cation norm is illustrated in Table 3.3. In this case the wt.% oxide values (column 1) are divided by their equivalent weights (divide by column 2 and multiply by column 4), converted into cation proportions (column 5) and then converted into cation percent (column 7). Molecules are then constructed according to the standard CIPW rules (Appendix 3.1), although the proportions of the components in which cations are allocated are different from the CIPW norm. The cation norm is not recalculated on a wt.% basis, but is expressed in molecular % (column 10). One advantage of the cation norm is that the proportions of opaque minerals are closer to their volume percentages as seen in thin section.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="normative-mineralogy-and-the-oxidation-state-of-iron">Normative Mineralogy and the Oxidation State of Iron<a class="hash-link" href="#normative-mineralogy-and-the-oxidation-state-of-iron" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The norm calculation is particularly sensitive to the oxidation state of iron. This is problematic for mafic rocks where the Fe content is typically much higher than in felsic rocks, and can be an issue for felsic rocks since magmatic systems generally become more oxidising as they evolve. Given that Fe is usually reported as either FeO or as Fe2O3 it is necessary to estimate the Fe2O3/FeO ratio in a given rock. Two approaches have been taken. In volcanic rocks, Middlemost (1989) assigned specific values of Fe2O3/FeO to particular rock types in TA-S space (Figure 3.3). El-Hinnawi (2016b), on the other hand, used a database of &gt;12,000 analyses for which Fe was measured as Fe2+ and Fe3+ to directly calculate the Fe2O3/FeO ratio. This study showed that there is a linear relationship between total alkalis (Na2O + K2O) and the degree of iron oxidation (OxFe = Fe2O3/(Fe2O3 + FeO) in wt.%) in the alkalic and sub-alkalic volcanic rock series (Figure 3.5). The equations are:</p><p>$$ For alkalic samples, OX_{Fe} = 0.033(Na_2O + K_2O) + 0.163 $$</p><p>$$ For sub - alkalic samples, OX_{Fe} = 0.072(Na_2O + K_2O) + 0.03 $$</p><p>These results are applicable to the majority of volcanic rock types, although ‘transitional’ basalts with compositions between the two fields are more difficult to constrain.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Average degree of iron oxidation associated with total alkalis of the alkalic and sub-alkalic volcanic rock series." src="/assets/images/fig3-5-227c5f8b2aaf054479fb4386c69bb62a.png" title="与碱性和亚碱性火山岩系列的总碱金属相关的平均铁氧化程度（OxFe = Fe2O3/(Fe2O3 + FeO)）（根据 El-Hinnawi，2016b）。" width="1080" height="403" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Average degree of iron oxidation (OxFe = Fe2O3/(Fe2O3 + FeO)) associated with total alkalis of the alkalic and sub-alkalic volcanic rock series (after El-Hinnawi, 2016b).

The arrows indicate direction of evolution from basaltic (ba) to rhyolitic (rh)/phonolitic (ph) compositions. The shaded area indicates region of ‘transitional’ basalts, which will have intermediate OxFe.</p><p>Given the widespread use of normative mineralogy in classifying basaltic and granitic rocks and the impact the oxidation state of Fe can have on the normative mineralogy, it is necessary to specify how Fe has been allocated between its two oxidation states when reporting the results of norm calculations.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/Books/UGD/en/3.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_dcUD" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>编辑此页</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_foO9"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="文档分页导航"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/Books/UGD/en/2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">上一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">_Ⅱ -_ Analysing Geochemical Data</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/Books/UGD/en/4"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">下一页</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">_Ⅳ -_ Using Trace Element Data</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Introduction</a><ul><li><a href="#processing-major-element-data" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Processing Major Element Data</a></li><li><a href="#major-element-mobility" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Major Element Mobility</a></li><li><a href="#the-compositions-of-some-major-earth-reservoirs" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Compositions of Some Major Earth Reservoirs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#rock-classification" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Rock Classification</a><ul><li><a href="#classifying-igneous-rocks-using-oxide-oxide-plots" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Classifying Igneous Rocks Using Oxide-Oxide Plots</a></li><li><a href="#classifying-igneous-rocks-using-normative-mineralogy" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Classifying Igneous Rocks Using Normative Mineralogy</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">文章</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">交流</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://space.bilibili.com/159204903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">哔哩哔哩<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">其他</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/tigerhall/dupal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">TigerHall © 2022 Dupal</div></div></div></footer></div>
